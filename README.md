# üìò C Programming ‚Äì 5-Week Course Syllabus

This 5-week course introduces core concepts of the C programming language.  
It is designed for **second-year Computer Science students** who already know Java and/or C++ and will continue with Python afterward.  
Each week consists of one **lecture** (2√ó45 min) and one **lab** (2√ó45 min).

## Week 1 ‚Äì Introduction & C Basics
**Lecture**
- History and role of C (systems, embedded, portability)
- Program structure (`#include`, `main`, standard library)
- Compilation process (source ‚Üí preprocessor ‚Üí compiler ‚Üí linker ‚Üí executable)
- Data types (`int`, `char`, `float`, `double`), variables, and constants
- Input/output using `printf` and `scanf`

**Lab**
- Set up environment (GitHub Codespaces / VS Code + GCC)
- Write, compile, and run ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù
- Simple arithmetic calculator
- Explore `printf` / `scanf` format specifiers

---

## Week 2 ‚Äì Control Flow & Functions
**Lecture**
- Operators and precedence
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do‚Ä¶while`)
- Functions: prototypes, parameters, return types, scope (`auto`, `static`)
- Comparing Java methods vs C functions

**Lab**
- Write branching and looping programs
- Create functions (factorial, prime test, calculator)
- Trace program flow and debug using print statements

---

## Week 3 ‚Äì Arrays, Strings & Pointers (Introduction)
**Lecture**
- One-dimensional and multidimensional arrays
- Strings as character arrays and null termination
- Introduction to pointers: addresses, dereferencing, pointer‚Äìarray relationship
- Function arguments by value vs by pointer

**Lab**
- Implement manual string functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`)
- Work with numeric arrays (min, max, average)
- Pass pointers to functions (swap two values)

---

## Week 4 ‚Äì Advanced Pointers, Dynamic Memory & Structures
**Lecture**
- Pointer arithmetic and pointer to pointer
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
- `struct` definitions and field access
- `typedef`, `union`, and `enum`

**Lab**
- Create dynamic arrays with `malloc`
- Define and use a `struct` (e.g., Student record)
- Build a small in-memory database (array of structs)

---

## Week 5 ‚Äì Files, Preprocessor & Modular Programming
**Lecture**
- File I/O (`fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fread`, `fwrite`)
- Preprocessor directives (`#include`, `#define`, conditional compilation)
- Separate compilation and header files
- Debugging and best practices

**Lab**
- Read/write data from files
- Save and load structured records
- Split program into multiple source and header files
- Mini-project: Student management system with file persistence

---

## Course Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Write, compile, and debug C programs in a Linux/GCC environment  
- Apply control flow, functions, arrays, strings, and pointers effectively  
- Manage dynamic memory and create composite data types using `struct`  
- Work with text and binary files  
- Organize programs into multiple source files with headers  
- Understand how C differs from Java and how it connects to Python  
- Demonstrate foundational skills for later systems and software courses
